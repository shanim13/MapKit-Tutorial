This is an example repository for the Map-Kit tutoial.
Swift 5 is used in this.
In main ViewController, I have implemented the MapKit and in the LocationVC it's Search Controller.

Used Delegates, Imported Core location to use CLGeocoder, added Gestures, Placemarks.
Dropping pins in all the location but zooming on the clicked one.
